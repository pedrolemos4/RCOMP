RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1190769 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

* T.1.1 Development of a structured cabling project for building 1,
and also encompassing the campus backbone.
* T.1.2 Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.
* T.1.3 Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.
* T.1.4 Development of a structured cabling project for building 4.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

#### Technical Decisions: ####
  * The backbone cables used will be optical fibres because even if the optical fibre is not imposed due to the cable length, it should always be enforced. Optical fibre grants higher bandwidth and better compatibility with future layer two technologies.
  * The cable types we will be using are 568A
# 3. Subtasks assignment #
