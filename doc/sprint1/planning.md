RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1190769 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

* T.1.1 Development of a structured cabling project for building 1,
and also encompassing the campus backbone.
* T.1.2 Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.
* T.1.3 Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.
* T.1.4 Development of a structured cabling project for building 4.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

#### Technical Decisions: ####
  * The backbone cables used will be optical fibres because even if the optical fibre is not imposed due to the cable length, it should always be enforced. Optical fibre grants higher bandwidth and better compatibility with future layer two technologies.
  * The cabling infrastructure adopted: 568A
  * The copper cable type adopted was CAT6A since they cover frequency signals up to 500MHz, they are capable of transmitting signals up to 10Gbps. CAT6A cable is used to support data rates over 100 meters.
    It also has almost the same capabilities as the CAT7 type cables and is less expensive.
# 3. Subtasks assignment #
