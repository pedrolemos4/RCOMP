RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1190769 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

* T.1.1 Development of a structured cabling project for building 1,
and also encompassing the campus backbone.
* T.1.2 Development of a structured cabling project for building 2.
* T.1.3 Development of a structured cabling project for building 3.
* T.1.4 Development of a structured cabling project for building 4.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

#### Technical Decisions: ####
  * The backbone cables used were optical fibres because even if the optical fibre is not imposed due to the cable length, it should always be enforced. Optical fibre grants higher bandwidth and better compatibility with future layer two technologies.
  * The cabling infrastructure adopted was 568A
  * The copper cable type adopted was Category 6 Augmented (CAT6A) since they cover frequency signals up to 500MHz, they are capable of transmitting signals up to 10Gbps. CAT6A cable is used to support data rates over 100 meters.
    It also has similar capabilities to the Category 7 (CAT7) type cables and is less expensive.
  * The connectors type adopted was RJ45 (8P8C).
  * For the telecommunication enclosures sizes, we decided to calculate the maximum that we would require and leave 50% empty for future improvements use that as a standard across all buildings.
  * Fibre cables were used in order to connect between the exterior and the Main Cross-Connect, between the Main Cross-Connect and the Intermediate Cross-Connect, between Horizontal Cross-Connects and Consolidation Points and between Intermediate Cross-Connect and Horizontal Cross-Connects.
  * For all the connections using fibre cables, we use two cables instead of one in order to assure redundancy.
  * Copper cables were used in order to connect the Consolidation Points to the outlets.
